# My Favorite Vacation Destination!

## Countries
### Australia
>I lived in Springvale in Victoria just east of Melbourne. It was a lot of fun living there for a year where I got to experience and _entirely_ different culture and different ways of living.
## States
### Florida
>I was, unfortunately, born in Venice, Florida. Living on the Gulf Coast was nice but I have never liked the heat or the humidity or even the **massive** bugs that come with it. I currently live here now just outside of Orlando.
### New York City
> The last vacation I went on was in 2016 to New York City for thanksgiving. I got to go to a ton of museums and I _literally_ ( but more so figurately) ate my weight in bagels and pretzels. ![The Frick Museum on E 70th, NYC](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/637045241924288525/765274710836772916/10690141_10203644004801721_6657333974923668757_n.jpg)
 ### Washington State
 > I lived here for about four years. I started off living in a small studio apartment on Capital Hill and eventually moved to Ballard. The car trip from Florida to Seattle was long but my cats seemed to enjoy the sun time they got.

### Michigan
> While I was born in Florida, Michigan is where I consider to be my hometown. It is where I went to high school and where I grew up the most.
